- 👋 Hi, I’m @Usires
- 👀 I’m interested in catching up on nerdy stuff I wanted to learn and do in my childhood. In this case: Programming!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, C++, Python. Just because it feels great to finally get wrap my head around it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C programming, best practices on more efficient methods.
- 📫 How to reach me is very easy, just drop me a message here on Github. :)
